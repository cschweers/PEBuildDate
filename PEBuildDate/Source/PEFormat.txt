Load Configuration Directory
The data directory entry for a pre-reserved SEH load configuration structure
must specify a particular size of the load configuration structure because
the operating system loader always expects it to be a certain value. In that
regard, the size is really only a version check. For compatibility with
Windows XP and earlier versions of Windows, the size must be 64 for x86
images.

Load Configuration Layout
The load configuration structure has the following layout for 32-bit and
64-bit PE files:

Offset	Size	Field	        Description
0       4       Characteristics Flags that indicate attributes of the file,
                currently unused. 
4       4       TimeDateStamp   Date and time stamp value. The value is
                represented in the number of seconds that have elapsed since
                midnight (00:00:00), January 1, 1970, Universal Coordinated
				Time, according to the system clock. The time stamp can be
				printed by using the C runtime (CRT) time function.
